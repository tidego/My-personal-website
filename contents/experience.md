I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this. It means a lot to me, and I’d like to share a bit more context on the experience listed in my resume.

### **National First Prize, China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM)**  

I led the formation of our team and began preparing for our first modeling competition in January 2024. Throughout the process, I systematically learned how to translate real‑world problems into mathematical models and sharpened my skills in literature review, academic writing, and data visualization. This competition marked the starting point of my research career. I gained hands‑on experience with various mathematical models, experimented with intelligent algorithms, studied model optimization and data‑analysis techniques, and significantly improved my teamwork abilities.

### **Reinforcement‑Learning‑Driven Simulation of Urban Policy Transfer Effects and Carbon‑Emission Efficiency Prediction**  

This paper stems from our team’s long‑term work in statistical modeling and was inspired by the question of whether historical policies can be transplanted. Based on three assumptions:
1.Changes in a province’s development features between two consecutive years are entirely caused by the previous year’s policies;
2.Future policy impacts must lie within the subset of impacts produced by the province’s historical policies;
3.If a province adopts one of its historical policies in the future, that policy will influence development features in the same way as it did in the past.
We developed a highly interpretable model for policy‑transfer simulation and carbon‑emission efficiency prediction. Comparative experiments show that our model enjoys an advantage in fitting accuracy.

### **A Study on the Practical Utility of AIGC Tools in Audiovisual Creation and Users' Willingness to Accept the Generated Works**

In this project I effectively served as the deputy lead. Although the competition focused on market survey and analysis, the knowledge‑graph‑based multi‑agent analysis system we employed is closely related to my academic background and research interests.This experience made me reflect on how markets operate. Academic research should not only serve society and lead to technological advancements, but also generate market and commercial value.

### **Reversing the Prompt, Revealing the Model**

Under the supervision of my supervisor, I systematically studied knowledge graphs. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), many traditional knowledge graph tasks can now be addressed by LLMs due to their enhanced semantic understanding. Inspired by evolutionary genetics, I initially attempted to design a multi-agent evolutionary system with life cycles, using a knowledge graph as the knowledge repository. However, due to the complexity of the project and limited computational resources, we shifted—on my supervisor’s advice—to research on prompt engineering. The paper currently in progress compares the Doubao and Qwen LLM series. Preliminary experiments suggest that more capable models are often more likely to generate toxic content when using the TPR approach. Given the scarcity of reference materials in this area, considerable further work is required to complete a high-quality paper, which we plan to submit to a CCF-C conference.

### **Smart Community System Based on WeChat Mini Program**
This was the first project where I applied my knowledge in a real-world setting. As a core team member of the “Smart Community” system, I participated in building a WeChat Mini Program that integrates IoT and AI technologies to deliver digital services within a residential community. It was my first time developing a full-stack application, where I worked primarily on frontend development, user interface design, and backend logic using Tencent Cloud’s serverless infrastructure. I also contributed to refining reports and preparing competition presentations.
