In graduate study, I aim to strengthen my theoretical foundation, enhance my research skills, and pursue meaningful and innovative work. I hope to publish papers at top-tier conferences (A-level) and in top SCI journals.

- **Senior undergraduate year**: I will invest more time in building solid research skills, integrate early into the research group, explore cutting-edge topics, and strive to publish my first paper before officially starting graduate study. I also plan to stay physically active and communicate proactively with peers and mentors.

- **First year of master's**: I will focus on coursework, read extensively, and deepen my understanding of frontier research directions. My goal is to publish a second paper and explore the integration of theory and practical applications.

- **Second year**: With a year of accumulation, I will begin preparing for my thesis proposal, participate in academic conferences, and aim to publish a third paper.

- **Third year**: I will complete my master’s thesis and plan my next steps—either pursuing a Ph.D. or applying my skills in industry for real-world impact.
